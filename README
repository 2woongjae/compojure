ABOUT
-----

Compojure is a web framework for the Clojure programming language. It places a
strong emphasis on code that is both concise and readable, and correct and
robust.

QUICK START
-----------

Build the Compojure jar with ant, and then place the jar in your classpath to
use.

    $ ant

Compojure requires several dependencies, detailed in the next section. You can
use the deps.sh script to automatically download and build the dependencies in
the deps directory.

    $ ./deps.sh

DEPENDENCIES
------------

Clojure and Clojure-Contrib are required libraries for Compojure:

- clojure.jar
  svn co https://clojure.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/clojure clojure

- clojure-contrib.jar
  svn co https://clojure-contrib.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/clojure-contrib clojure-contrib

Jetty is used as the default web server for Compojure, but because Compojure
uses standard Java servlets, you could potentially use any web server with
servlet support.

- servlet-api-2.5.6.1.14.jar
- jetty-6.1.14.zip
  http://dist.codehaus.org/jetty/jetty-6.1.14/jetty-6.1.14.zip
