- Support for wildcards (splats) in routes would be nice:

    (GET "/download/*"             ; can match subdirectories too
      (file "download" (route :*)

- Support for regexs would be a nice advanced feature:

    (GET #"/(.*?)\.(\w+)"
      (str "Route: "     (route 1) "\n"
           "Extension: " (route 2) "\n"
